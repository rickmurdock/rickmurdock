This site showcases some of the projects built and skills learned at The Iron Yard where I was a front-end engineering student. 
The Iron Yard is a 12 week, full-time immersive code school providing a full stack-foundation of both front-end and back-end fundamentals, including a language
specialization in JavaScript with ReactJS.
